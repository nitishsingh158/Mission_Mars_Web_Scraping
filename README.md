# Mission to Mars : A Beginners Introduction to Web Scraping
This application scrapes the web for the latest news and facts about the planet Mars.  Since I am interested in the different hemispheres as well, the app also scrapes full-size pictures for each hemisphere and displays all the information on one webpage. All this is done in a sequence using various Python, the Flask module and Bootstrap 3.3.7.
